=head1 NAME

Perl6::Export::Attrs - The Perl 6 'is export(...)' trait as a Perl 5 attribute


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Perl6::Export::Attrs version 0.0.3


=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package Some::Module;
    use Perl6::Export::Attrs;

	# Export &foo by default, when explicitly requested,
	# or when the ':ALL' export set is requested...

	sub foo :Export(:DEFAULT) {
		print "phooo!";
	}


	# Export &var by default, when explicitly requested,
	# or when the ':bees', ':pubs', or ':ALL' export set is requested...
	# the parens after 'is export' are like the parens of a qw(...)

	sub bar :Export(:DEFAULT :bees :pubs) {
		print "baaa!";
	}


	# Export &baz when explicitly requested
	# or when the ':bees' or ':ALL' export set is requested...

	sub baz :Export(:bees) {
		print "baassss!";
	}


	# Always export &qux 
	# (no matter what else is explicitly or implicitly requested)

	sub qux :Export(:MANDATORY) {
		print "quuuuuuuuux!";
	}


	IMPORT {
		# This block is called when the module is used (as usual),
		# but it is called after any export requests have been handled.
		# Those requests will have been stripped from its @_ argument list
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements a Perl 5 native version of what the Perl 6 symbol export mechanism
will look like.

It's very straightforward:

=over

=item *

If you want a subroutine to be capable of being exported (when
explicitly requested in the C<use> arguments), you mark it
with the C<:Export> attribute.

=item *

If you want a subroutine to be automatically exported when the module is
used (without specific overriding arguments), you mark it with
the C<:Export(:DEFAULT)> attribute.

=item *

If you want a subroutine to be automatically exported when the module is
used (even if the user specifies overriding arguments), you mark it with
the C<:Export(:MANDATORY)> attribute.

=item * 

If the subroutine should also be exported when particular export groups
are requested, you add the names of those export groups to the attribute's
argument list.

=back

That's it.

=head2 C<IMPORT> blocks

Perl 6 replaces the C<import> subroutine with an C<IMPORT> block. It's
analogous to a C<BEGIN> or C<END> block, except that it's executed every
time the corresponding module is C<use>'d. 

The C<IMPORT> block is passed the argument list that was specified on
the C<use> line that loaded the corresponding module. However, any
export specifications (names of subroutines or tagsets to be exported)
will have already been removed from that argument list before
C<IMPORT> receives it.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item %s does not export: %s\nuse %s failed

You tried to import the specified subroutine, but the module didn't
export it. Often caused by a misspelling, or forgetting to add an
C<:Export> attribute to the definition of the subroutine in question.

=item Bad tagset in :Export attribute at %s line %s: [%s]

You tried to import a collection of subroutines via a tagset, but the module
didn't export any subroutines under that tagset. Is the tagset name misspelled
(maybe you forgot the colon?).

=item Internal error: missing symbol for %s

A subroutine was specified as being exported during module compilation
but mysteriously ceased to exist before the module was imported. 

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Perl6::Export::Attrs requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the Attribute::Handlers module to handle the attributes.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
Note that the module does not support exporting variables.
This is considered a I<feature>, not a bug. See Chapter 17 of
Perl Best Practices (O'Reilly, 2005).
